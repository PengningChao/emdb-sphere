This is code used for the publication https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08168. It computes bounds on electromagnetic scattering properties such as scattering/absorption cross sections and near-field Purcell enhancement for any possible single material structure, given only constraints on the susceptibility of the material and a spherical bounding domain for which the structure must fit in.
